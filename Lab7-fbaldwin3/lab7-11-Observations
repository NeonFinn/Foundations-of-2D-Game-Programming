3. Experimenting with bounding boxes helped me better understand how javascript handles object collisions. Messing with the
dimensions and positions of the boxes also allows me to decide what kind of interaction I want between objects. For example,
I might not want the bees wings to trigger a collision with the player, so I can make the bounding box smaller than the actual image.
Other times you may want a powerup to have a large collision area to make it easier for the player to collect with all that
is going on in the scene.
