1. When that line of code is commented out, the game still treats the time paused as run time. When resumed, the game will
seemingly jump forward in time. When you uncomment that line the game once again calculates the adjustment and resumes exactly
where the player left off.

2. "snailBait" can be used inside the constructor instead of "this:. Using "this" is often times more explicit. Inside methods,
you mostly use "this" to refer to the object itself. It helps keep the correct reference when functions are called from different
places, especially in callbacks like setTimeout or onload.

3. This question was quite confusing. But to my knowledge, in var self = this; using "this" captures the current instance of the class. Using "this"
in the this.background.onload callback refers to the image and not snailBait. By using self.startGame instead it ensures you call
it on the right object.
