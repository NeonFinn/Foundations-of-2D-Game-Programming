1. Creating a gif was not too difficult. I found two images and then a online free gif maker. It would look better
if I had drawn them myself because it doesn't exactly match up.

2. Clearing my browsers cache did increase the loading screen time a little bit. I'm not sure if it is because my computer
has a high processing power but I can see the gif for a second before the game loads.

3. Adding the styling to the CSS instead of in methods achieves the same result but is more efficient because you can change
the styling in one place instead of having to change it in multiple methods.

4. Increasing the countdown only required you to change the numbers and add two more lines of the previous code with the
correct numbers. This is not efficient because if you wanted to change the countdown to 20, you would have to add 15 more lines
to achieve the same result.
