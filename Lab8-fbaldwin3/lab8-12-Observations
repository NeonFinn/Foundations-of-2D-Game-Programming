1. If the initial velocity of the runner is approximately 310 pixels per second and the game is running at 60fps,
the player is falling approximately 5.17 pixels each frame (310 pixels/60 frames = 5.17 pixels/frame).

2. The vertical velocity when the runner stops falling depends on how far the player falls before landing. When the player is
first dropped into the game after dying, the velocity is around 350-390 pixels per second. However, if the player simply walks
off the starter platform, the vertical velocity is 281 pixels per second. Jumping from the highest platform to the lowest
platform results in a vertical velocity of approximately 460 pixels per second.
