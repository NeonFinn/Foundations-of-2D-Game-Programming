1. Changing the background image only requires changing the URL in the JavaScript file. The rest remains the same.

2. To draw the runner at different locations, you first have to remove the hardcoded values for x and y in the drawRunner function.
Then, you can pass in different x and y values when calling the function to position the runner at different locations on the canvas.

3. Drawing the background at different locations is similar to drawing the runner. You can modify the drawBackground function to accept x and y parameters,
and then call it with different values to position the background image to your liking. This isn't the most practical for a background image though, as it
causes overlap and clipping.

4. To draw the runner and then the background all you have to do is switch the position of the function calls. This causes the background to now be drawn
over top of the runner which covers it up on the canvas. The runner is still there but now is not visible.

5. Removing the width and height attributes from the HTML file and adding it to the CSS file is pretty straightforward. However, the changed code does not
output the same result as before. This is because the canvas's resolution is still technically 300 x 150, but it is being stretched to 800 x 400 by the CSS.
Instead of the actual canvas size being changed we are stretching the image. As a result, it looks blurry or distorted since the pixels are scaled up.
