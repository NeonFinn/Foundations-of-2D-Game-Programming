1. In the original code, the runner pauses and then resumes right where she was when you pressed the button. Commenting out the pause()
and unpause() lines from the jump behavior can cause the player to teleport straight down as if the they kept moving down
regardless of if the game was paused. Sometimes she also falls down at the correct rate, but continues to go past the "ground"
level before teleporting back up to where shes supposed to be.
